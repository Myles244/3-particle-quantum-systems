-fixed the problem leading to good conversion for the ground state energy of normal helium
-switched to muonic helium and it only worked for a few basis states
-calculated the dirac delta expctation value
-the difference is likely caused by precision errors
    - changed to atomic units to reduce unesesary factors of wierd numbers
    - still not working so i ended up rewriting the progeram using the mpmath library which has unlimited floating point precision
        -mostly just a replacement
-seems to be working now, but much slower
-got it to calculate the HFS and it has a decent agreements
-quantify error, at least quantify convergence error
